description: Reduce comment verbosity in target files — remove restate-the-code comments and "thinking in comments", keep or sharpen non-obvious WHY, and make public doc comments a relaxed, customer-facing guide.
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob
---

Prune comments in the target files. Default scope: $ARGUMENTS. If no argument is given, prune the files changed on the current branch (vs. `main`) plus unstaged/untracked files — i.e. `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` ∪ `git status --porcelain`.

Two kinds of comment live in this crate and they pull in opposite directions:

- **Internal comments** (`//` inside function bodies, private items) — the governing default is **no comment**. The burden of proof is on *retention*: a comment survives only by saying something the code cannot. When you can't decide, delete. "It's not wrong" is not a reason to keep one.
- **Public doc comments** (`///`, `//!` on public items) — these are the crate's documentation and render on docs.rs. The default flips: a public item *should* be documented, and the bar is "does this help a reader use the crate?" not "does it say something the code can't?" Don't strip these to fragments. See **Doc comments** below.

**Zero is a valid result.** If a file's comments all earn their place, leave it untouched and report "no changes." Do not lower the bar to find work. Do not delete a load-bearing WHY to feel productive. A run that touches nothing is a correct run when the comments are already disciplined.

## Internal comments

### Remove

- **Restate-the-code.** A comment that paraphrases the next line. `// increment counter` over `i += 1`. `// loop over batches` over `for batch in batches`. `// return early if none` over `let Some(x) = x else { return };`. The identifier and structure already say it.
- **Thinking in comments.** Running narration of the author's decision process: "we tried X but switched to Y", "TODO: maybe refactor this later", "consider whether this should be...", "first we do A, then we do B, finally C". Section headers that recap the next 5 lines. Planning prose that belonged in a PR description.
- **Change-history annotations.** "was `bool`, now an enum", "added for the shadow effect", "previously a fixed-size ring", "renamed from foo", "extracted from noesis_bevy". That's what git is for; the diff and commit message carry it, the source must not.
- **Phase / task / caller bookkeeping.** `(Phase 4.B)`, "used by `aor_render`", "fixes #1234", "part of the handle-seam work", references to roadmap items. Restating a phase or a caller on individual items is decoration that rots when the phase ends, the caller is renamed, or the issue closes. Belongs in commit messages and PR descriptions. The one exception is in Keep below — a phase marker that encodes a real removal trigger.
- **SDK-mirror / port annotations.** "mirrors `Shader.140.frag`", "matches `GLRenderDevice`", "ports the D3D11 sampler table". The device and `noesis.wgsl` are authored *against* the SDK reference devices by design; restating that on each identifier is noise and the citation rots when the SDK moves. Drop it — unless the reference is the *anchor* for a non-obvious correctness note (see Keep).
- **Banner / separator comments.** `// ===== HELPERS =====`, `// --- private methods ---`, ASCII-art dividers. The codebase's `// ── Section ──` headers are fine *only* when they label a genuine region of a long file and say something the next identifier doesn't — a bare divider over one function is noise. If a file is so long it needs banners to navigate, the fix is to split the file.
- **Commented-out code.** Delete it. Git remembers. The only exception: a single line documenting a known-broken alternative *with* a one-line reason it's disabled (e.g. `// AddressMode::ClampToBorder  // disabled — downlevel wgpu has no border color`).
- **Stale / contradicted comments.** Any comment whose claim disagrees with the current code. Either fix it or remove it; never leave the lie. (The per-phase encoder, per-draw uniform slot, and shim-only `Batch::*_handle()` invariants are load-bearing — a comment that contradicts them is actively dangerous.)
- **Trivial field/parameter comments.** `size: UVec2, // the size`. `queue: RenderQueue, // render queue`. If the name is bad, fix the name; don't paper over it.
- **Closing-brace labels.** `} // end of if`, `} // impl WgpuRenderDevice`. The editor folds; the indentation shows scope.

### Keep (and sharpen if vague)

Fitting one of these categories makes a comment *eligible* to survive — it does not make it survive. The comment must also carry a WHY a competent reader of *this code* would actually miss. A category match over an obvious-anyway fact is still a delete.

- **Non-obvious WHY.** A choice that would surprise a reader: why this algorithm over the textbook one, why this loop bound, why this order of operations matters. (E.g. the `Clear` stencil mode's dead `fail_op: Replace`, which keeps wgpu emitting the stencil reference — surprising, load-bearing, keep.)
- **Hidden constraints / invariants.** "Every `write_buffer` in a phase lands before its submit, so draws can't share a uniform slot." "Noesis tiles are bottom-left origin; wgpu scissors top-left." "Only valid for textures the shim created." Anything a future editor could violate by mistake. The architectural invariants (no `unsafe`, SDK-free core without `shim`, one encoder per phase, `Rgba8Unorm` targets) are exactly this kind of anchor.
- **Units / encoding.** `premultiplied alpha`, `bytes, not texels`, `bottom-left origin`, `row-major Matrix4`. A bare number or buffer whose unit/encoding isn't obvious from its type earns a comment.
- **Workaround citations.** A comment paired with a concrete external reference: a Noesis SDK quirk, a wgpu or Vulkan validation rule (a VUID), an SDK header path. The citation is the value — bare "// workaround" is not.
- **Subtle correctness anchors.** "Bind groups expose one struct-sized window; the dynamic offset slides it to the draw's slot." "No copy on growth: earlier draws hold the old buffer through the encoder." Things tests can't easily catch but reviewers reliably get wrong.
- **Scope-limited phase markers** *only* when they encode a real removal trigger, e.g. `// PHASE-9-REMOVE: intermediate + blit, once PipelineCache keys on format`. A bare "(Phase 5.B)" gets cut.

## Doc comments

`///` and `//!` on public items are the crate's published documentation — what a reader sees on docs.rs, not just an inline note. The goal here is a **useful, readable guide to the crate**, not the terse minimalism that governs internal comments. Keep them; make them good.

What "good" means here:

- **Relaxed and reader-facing.** Write the way good module docs read: plain, direct, second person where it helps ("Call this before the onscreen phase", "Pass the handles your host resolved"). Full sentences are welcome — this is prose a stranger reads to learn the crate, not a margin note.
- **Orient first, then qualify.** Lead with what the type or function is *for* and when you'd reach for it. On docs.rs the reader may not have the signature in front of them, so a one-line orientation earns its place even when it restates the WHAT a little. Then add the gotcha that bites: threading, drop order, an ordering constraint, a returned `None` meaning.
- **Tie into the protocol.** Every public method is a step of Noesis's render-device protocol (texture phase, offscreen phase, onscreen phase). A doc comment that names where the call sits in that sequence orients the reader fast.
- **Link related items.** `[`WgpuRenderDevice::draw_batch_with`]`, `[`BatchTextures`]`. Intra-doc links are what turn a flat list of items into a navigable guide; prefer them over bare backtick names.

Strip the AI tone from doc prose — it reads as filler and dates badly:

- **Em-dashes.** Don't use `—`. Rewrite with a period, comma, parentheses, or a colon. This is a hard project rule for both doc and internal comments — the codebase is full of them and they're being removed.
- **Throat-clearing.** "Note that", "It's important to note", "Keep in mind", "As you can see", "Here we". Just state the fact.
- **Filler intensifiers and marketing.** "simply", "just", "easily", "powerful", "robust", "seamless", "leverage", "utilize", "blazingly". Cut them; say the plain verb.
- **Hedging on known facts.** "should generally", "might typically". If it's a fact, state it. If it's genuinely conditional, say the condition.
- **Narrated process.** "First we do A, then B, finally C" walkthroughs of an obvious body. Document the contract, not the steps.
- **Restate-only docstrings.** A `///` that only re-says the signature ("Takes a `&Batch` and draws it") with nothing added. Either add the orientation/gotcha that makes it useful, or drop it and let the signature speak — an empty-calorie docstring is worse than none.

Doc comments still obey the internal-comment removal rules for *noise*: no phase markers (`(Phase 5.C)`), no `TODO.md` / roadmap references, no change-history, no SDK-mirror annotations, no "thinking out loud" inside a `///`. Strip those even when the surrounding doc stays.

Worked sharpenings — de-AI'd and oriented, not amputated:

- `//! The wgpu render device (Phase 4.B).` → `//! [`WgpuRenderDevice`] and [`BatchTextures`].` (drop the phase marker; orient instead)
- `/// This function simply leverages wgpu to easily create a powerful device from the given queue.` → `/// Creates a device that renders with `device` and submits to `queue`.`
- `/// Sets the target — note that you must call it before rendering.` → `/// Sets the view that onscreen draws render into. Call it before an onscreen phase whenever the target changes.`

## Process

1. Resolve the file set from `$ARGUMENTS` (or the default git-derived set above). Exclude generated/vendored/external trees: anything under `target/`, the SDK (`$NOESIS_SDK_DIR`), the gitignored `assets/Data` / `assets/Fonts` symlinks, and any file marked generated.
2. Read each file fully before editing — context matters; a comment near the top may be load-bearing for code at the bottom.
3. For each comment, first decide which kind it is. Internal `//`: classify against Remove/Keep; to keep one, state its WHY/invariant to yourself in a single clause, and if that clause just paraphrases the code or you reach for "context"/"clarity"/"it helps", delete. Public `///`/`//!`: keep it, but make it earn its place as a guide — de-AI the tone, kill em-dashes, add the missing orientation or gotcha, strip embedded noise. Uncertainty on an internal comment resolves to deletion; uncertainty on a public doc resolves to a clearer, relaxed rewrite.
4. Apply edits with `Edit`. Do not reflow unrelated code, do not rename, do not reorder. Comments only.
5. After editing, report a per-file tally: `src/render.rs — removed 7, rewrote 2, kept 4` (count a de-AI'd doc rewrite under "rewrote"). No diff dumps; the user can read the diff themselves.
6. Do **not** run formatters, build, or tests. Comment-only edits don't change behavior; running CI here just adds latency and noise. If the user wants verification, they'll ask. (A `cargo doc` preview is the one thing worth offering after a doc-heavy run.)

## Tone for internal rewrites

A kept internal comment is worth keeping *and* worth shortening. Sharpening is part of the prune, not a separate nicety — a verbose survivor is a half-done removal. (Doc comments are the exception: relaxed prose is the point there, not a fragment.)

- A fragment beats a sentence. Cut to the surprising token and stop. No subject, no verb, no closing punctuation if they earn nothing.
- One line. A citation may take a second line; nothing else may. If the WHY won't fit on one line, the comment is carrying explanation that belongs in the commit/PR.
- Lead with the constraint or reason, not "This function...". Drop the WHAT the signature already states; keep only the WHY/invariant.
- No hedging ("maybe", "probably", "I think"). If it's uncertain, it isn't worth a comment.
- No first person, no audience address. No em-dashes. Just state the fact.

Worked sharpenings — each cuts the restated WHAT and keeps only the surprising part:

- `// We give every draw its own uniform slot because all of the queue writes in a phase land before the encoder is submitted, so a shared slot would leave every draw reading the last value` → `// writes land before submit; a shared slot reads the last value`
- `// We have to flip the tile here because Noesis gives tiles with a bottom-left origin while wgpu scissor rects start at the top-left` → `// Noesis tiles are bottom-left origin; wgpu scissors top-left`
- `// We clamp instead of using ClampToZero because downlevel wgpu has no border color and the shader masks out-of-rect samples anyway` → `// no border color on downlevel; CLAMP_PATTERN masks in the shader`

## What this skill is not

Not a refactor pass. Not a rename pass. Not a "improve the code" pass. If pruning a comment reveals that the code itself is unclear, **leave the code alone** and either keep a sharpened comment or flag it in the final report ("`render::is_linear_float` reads obscurely without its old comment — consider renaming in a separate change"). The user decides whether to act on that.
